<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
I'm currently studying in India<br>
I like building open source software for my own use, and making it more accessible for other people<br>
Minimalistic things please me, as you can tell from the vibe of this website<br><br>
I mostly use technologies such as Rust, C, Python, Bash and Haskell

<style>
:global(body) {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    margin: 0;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
}
</style>
